## GoWasmHotReload: A Live Reloading Tool for Go + WebAssembly

### Overview  
GoWasmHotReload is a hot-reloading tool designed for Go WebAssembly (Wasm) projects. Inspired by **nodemon**, it automatically detects changes in Go source files, recompiles them into WebAssembly, and reloads the applicationâ€”eliminating the need for manual recompilation and browser refreshes.

### Key Features  
- **Automatic Go File Monitoring**: Watches `.go` files for changes and triggers a recompilation.  
- **Live WebAssembly Reloading**: Updates the `.wasm` file in real-time without restarting the server.  
- **Fast and Lightweight**: Optimized for minimal overhead and quick reload cycles.  
- **Configurable & Flexible**: Supports custom file paths, debounce settings, and optional manual triggers.  
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.  

### Use Case  
Perfect for **Go developers** working with **WebAssembly**, enabling a **smooth development workflow** by automating recompilation and reloading.
